# Horiseon-Accessibility-Standards

## Description
This repository is Module 1 Challenge. The client is the marketing agency, Horiseon, I am working on a codebase that follows accessibility standards for optimal search engine use. Before I began to work on the project the Lighthouse report generated a 70% accessibility score. After making the changes it is currently reporting an accessibility score of 94%.
